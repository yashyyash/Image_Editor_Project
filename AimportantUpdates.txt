update!! 

Gui trial code has been generated using Pyqt5. 
this a better approach! to use! 

**imageEditor.png has basic gui design try to replicate that in Pyqt5**

conda install pyqt
conda install -c conda-forge pyqt5-tools
On Windows, you might need to navigate to the Library\bin directory of your Conda environment and run designer.exe.

5. Convert .ui File to Python Code
Once your design is ready, convert the .ui file to a Python script with the following command:
pyuic5 -x yourfile.ui -o yourfile.py

6. Run the Python Script
You can now run the generated Python script to see your GUI in action:

python yourfile.py
This setup within a Conda environment should make it straightforward to start building and experimenting with PyQt GUIs.




pyqt5--->Editordraft1.ui------>gui1.py

make a gui similar to *ImageEditorIdea.png in folder*
